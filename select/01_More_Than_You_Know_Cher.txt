More than you know
More than you know
Man of my heart, I love you so
Lately I find you're on my mind
More than you know

Whether you're right
Whether you're wrong
Man of my heart, I'm gonna string along
I need you so
More than you'll ever know

Lovin' you the way that I do
There's nothing I can do about it
Lovin' maybe all you can give
But honey, I can't live without it

Oh, how I cry, oh, how I die
If you got tired and said goodbye
More than I chose
More than you'll ever know

Lovin' you the way that I do
There's nothing I can do about it
Lovin' maybe all you can give
But honey, I can't live without it

Oh, how I die, oh, how I cry
If you got tired and said goodbye
More than I chose
More than you'll ev...
More than you'll ev...,more than you'll ever know

Na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na
